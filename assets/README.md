# Assets folder

Place the persistent logo file here with the name `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`).
The app `gategroupDashboard.py` will use `assets/logo.png` if it exists. If you upload a logo via the app UI, it will be saved to this path.

Do not commit large images unless necessary. Keep the logo optimized for web (e.g., 400x80 or similar).
